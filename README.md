## What is Data Analytics

It's essential to understand what data analytics really is. This can be divided into two parts:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to explore and understand the structure, dimensions, and patterns within the data.
- **Advanced Analytics** to generate insights, track performance, and support decision-making using the organized data.
