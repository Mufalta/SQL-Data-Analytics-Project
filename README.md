# SQL-Data-Analytics-Project

Hi 👋, good to see you again, welcome to the **Data Analytics Project** repository!  
First of all, a huge thanks to **Baraa Khatib Salkini** for inspiring me to build this project about Data Analytics. This project continues the Data Warehouse project, so please check the repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/Mufalta/SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project.git).  
On this page, we're going to dive into a thorough analysis to find some business insights from organized data in the data warehouse.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** to explore and understand the structure, dimensions, and patterns within the data.
2. **Advanced Analytics:** to generate insights, track performance, and support decision-making using the organized data.

## What is Data Analytics

It's essential to understand what data analytics really is. Look at the image below:

## Create Database and Schema

The first thing we're going to do is create a database named 'DataWarehouseAnalytics' after checking if it already exists. If the database exists, it is dropped and recreated. Additionally, we create a schema called gold.  
``` sql
USE master;
GO

-- Drop and recreate the 'DataWarehouseAnalytics' database
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'DataWarehouseAnalytics')
BEGIN
    ALTER DATABASE DataWarehouseAnalytics SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
    DROP DATABASE DataWarehouseAnalytics;
END;
GO

-- Create the 'DataWarehouseAnalytics' database
CREATE DATABASE DataWarehouseAnalytics;
GO

USE DataWarehouseAnalytics;
GO

-- Create Schema
CREATE SCHEMA gold;
GO

-- Create Tables
CREATE TABLE gold.dim_customers(
	customer_key int,
	customer_id int,
	customer_number nvarchar(50),
	first_name nvarchar(50),
	last_name nvarchar(50),
	country nvarchar(50),
	marital_status nvarchar(50),
	gender nvarchar(50),
	birthdate date,
	create_date date
);
GO

CREATE TABLE gold.dim_products(
	product_key int ,
	product_id int ,
	product_number nvarchar(50) ,
	product_name nvarchar(50) ,
	category_id nvarchar(50) ,
	category nvarchar(50) ,
	subcategory nvarchar(50) ,
	maintenance nvarchar(50) ,
	cost int,
	product_line nvarchar(50),
	start_date date 
);
GO

CREATE TABLE gold.fact_sales(
	order_number nvarchar(50),
	product_key int,
	customer_key int,
	order_date date,
	shipping_date date,
	due_date date,
	sales_amount int,
	quantity tinyint,
	price int 
);
GO

-- Insert Data
TRUNCATE TABLE gold.dim_customers;
GO

BULK INSERT gold.dim_customers
FROM 'D:\Data with Baraa\SQL\sql-data-analytics-project\datasets\csv-files\gold.dim_customers.csv'
WITH (
	FIRSTROW = 2,
	FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
	TABLOCK
);
GO

TRUNCATE TABLE gold.dim_products;
GO

BULK INSERT gold.dim_products
FROM 'D:\Data with Baraa\SQL\sql-data-analytics-project\datasets\csv-files\gold.dim_products.csv'
WITH (
	FIRSTROW = 2,
	FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
	TABLOCK
);
GO

TRUNCATE TABLE gold.fact_sales;
GO

BULK INSERT gold.fact_sales
FROM 'D:\Data with Baraa\SQL\sql-data-analytics-project\datasets\csv-files\gold.fact_sales.csv'
WITH (
	FIRSTROW = 2,
	FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
	TABLOCK
);
GO
```

## Database Exploration

This section explores the structure of the database, including the list of tables and their schemas, in order to inspect the columns and metadata for specific tables.  
``` sql
-- Retrieve a list of all tables in the database
SELECT 
    TABLE_CATALOG, 
    TABLE_SCHEMA, 
    TABLE_NAME, 
    TABLE_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;

-- Retrieve all columns for a specific table (dim_customers)
SELECT 
    COLUMN_NAME, 
    DATA_TYPE, 
    IS_NULLABLE, 
    CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'dim_customers';
```

---

## Dimensions Exploration

This section explores the structure of dimension tables.
``` sql
-- Retrieve a list of unique countries from which customers originate
SELECT DISTINCT 
    country 
FROM gold.dim_customers
ORDER BY country;

-- Retrieve a list of unique categories, subcategories, and products
SELECT DISTINCT 
    category, 
    subcategory, 
    product_name 
FROM gold.dim_products
ORDER BY category, subcategory, product_name;
```

---

## Date Range Exploration

This section determines the temporal boundaries of key data points to understand the range of historical data.
```sql
-- Determine the first and last order date and the total duration in months
SELECT 
    MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date,
    MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date,
    DATEDIFF(MONTH, MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date)) AS order_range_months
FROM gold.fact_sales;

-- Find the youngest and oldest customer based on birthdate
SELECT
    MIN(birthdate) AS oldest_birthdate,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, MIN(birthdate), GETDATE()) AS oldest_age,
    MAX(birthdate) AS youngest_birthdate,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, MAX(birthdate), GETDATE()) AS youngest_age
FROM gold.dim_customers;
```

---

## Measures Exploration

This section calculates aggregated metrics (e.g., totals, averages) for quick insights to identify overall trends.
``` sql
-- Find the Total Sales
SELECT SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales FROM gold.fact_sales

-- Find how many items are sold
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity FROM gold.fact_sales

-- Find the average selling price
SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM gold.fact_sales

-- Find the Total number of Orders
SELECT COUNT(order_number) AS total_orders FROM gold.fact_sales
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_number) AS total_orders FROM gold.fact_sales

-- Find the total number of products
SELECT COUNT(product_name) AS total_products FROM gold.dim_products

-- Find the total number of customers
SELECT COUNT(customer_key) AS total_customers FROM gold.dim_customers;

-- Find the total number of customers that has placed an order
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers FROM gold.fact_sales;

-- Generate a Report that shows all key metrics of the business
SELECT 'Total Sales' AS measure_name, SUM(sales_amount) AS measure_value FROM gold.fact_sales
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Quantity', SUM(quantity) FROM gold.fact_sales
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Average Price', AVG(price) FROM gold.fact_sales
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Orders', COUNT(DISTINCT order_number) FROM gold.fact_sales
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Products', COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) FROM gold.dim_products
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Customers', COUNT(customer_key) FROM gold.dim_customers;
```

## Magnitude Analysis

This section quantifies data and group results by specific dimensions for understanding data distribution across categories.
``` sql
-- Find total customers by countries
SELECT
    country,
    COUNT(customer_key) AS total_customers
FROM gold.dim_customers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;

-- Find total customers by gender
SELECT
    gender,
    COUNT(customer_key) AS total_customers
FROM gold.dim_customers
GROUP BY gender
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;

-- Find total products by category
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(product_key) AS total_products
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_products DESC;

-- What is the average costs in each category?
SELECT
    category,
    AVG(cost) AS avg_cost
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_cost DESC;

-- What is the total revenue generated for each category?
SELECT
    p.category,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
    ON p.product_key = f.product_key
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;


-- What is the total revenue generated by each customer?
SELECT
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers c
    ON c.customer_key = f.customer_key
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- What is the distribution of sold items across countries?
SELECT
    c.country,
    SUM(f.quantity) AS total_sold_items
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers c
    ON c.customer_key = f.customer_key
GROUP BY c.country
ORDER BY total_sold_items DESC;
```

## Ranking Analysis

This section ranks items (e.g., products, customers) based on performance or other metrics to identify top performers.
``` sql
-- Which 5 products generate the Highest Revenue?
-- Simple Ranking
SELECT TOP 5
    p.product_name,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
    ON p.product_key = f.product_key
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Complex but Flexible Ranking Using Window Functions
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        p.product_name,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(f.sales_amount) DESC) AS rank_products
    FROM gold.fact_sales f
    LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
        ON p.product_key = f.product_key
    GROUP BY p.product_name
) AS ranked_products
WHERE rank_products <= 5;

-- What are the 5 worst-performing products in terms of sales?
SELECT TOP 5
    p.product_name,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
    ON p.product_key = f.product_key
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue;

-- Find the top 10 customers who have generated the highest revenue
SELECT TOP 10
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers c
    ON c.customer_key = f.customer_key
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- The 3 customers with the fewest orders placed
SELECT TOP 3
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COUNT(order_number) AS total_orders
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers c
    ON c.customer_key = f.customer_key
